# Introduction to GitHub Repository: Heart Disease Prediction

Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to the analysis and prediction of heart disease using machine learning techniques such as decision tree, random forest and neural network. In this repository, we aim to provide an in-depth exploration of a dataset sourced from 2022 annual CDC survey data of 400k+ adults, focusing on identifying patterns and features that correlate with the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Purpose:
The primary objective of this repository is to leverage the power of data science and machine learning to develop a predictive model capable of accurately determining the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various health parameters and clinical indicators.

## Dataset:
•	The dataset utilized in this analysis is sourced from 2022 annual CDC survey data of 400k+ adults related to their health status and comprises a comprehensive collection of patient attributes, including demographic information, medical test results, and lifestyle factors. Each entry in the dataset is labeled to denote the presence or absence of heart disease, serving as the ground truth for our predictive modeling task.

## Methodology:
Our approach to analyzing the dataset and building the predictive model follows a structured methodology, encompassing the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for analysis.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting thorough exploratory analysis to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and potential patterns within the data.

3. **Resampling: ** Implementing Resampling to resolve the imbalanced data which may cause inaccuracy

4. **Model Development:** Implementing machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests,  and neural network, to train predictive models on the pre-processed dataset.
  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, through techniques such as cross-validation and model comparison.
  
6. **Outcome and insight:** Deploying the best-performing model to predict heart disease probability for new, unseen data, thereby providing a practical tool for healthcare professionals and individuals to assess cardiovascular risk.

## Repository Structure:
Our GitHub repository is organized to facilitate ease of navigation and collaboration, comprising the following key components:

1. **Code:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts detailing the entire data analysis pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

2. **Data:** Houses the dataset used for analysis, along with any auxiliary files required for data manipulation or feature engineering.

3. **Documentation:** Provides detailed documentation, including a README file describing the project overview, data sources, methodology, and instructions for running the code.

4. **Results:** Includes visualizations, model performance metrics, and any additional outputs generated during the analysis process.

## Contribution:
We welcome contributions from the data science and healthcare communities to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of our predictive model. Whether you're interested in refining the analysis, experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, or optimizing model hyperparameters, your contributions are invaluable in advancing our understanding of heart disease prediction.

Thank you for visiting our GitHub repository dedicated to heart disease prediction. Together, we can leverage data-driven insights to improve healthcare outcomes and empower individuals to make informed decisions about their cardiovascular health.
